# CLI_lingae_learning
Just a little CLI game I made to simulate how human brain learns new words. 

## text analysis
  There function that does some text analysis on the user input integer and extracts the command, the attribute, the word and the value. 
## actual app
  gets size of dictionary, or the meaning of a particular word if needed. other stuff too. I'll add more detials if necesary. 
  
### to use the exe file
don't use it yet, but here are the commnds.
# Cmds: 
	a. Get word # Findes word in the database 
	b. Get -rt word # returns the root of word else returns an error
	c. Add word -ln root # adds word to the root link.
	d. Add word -vlu <string> # adds the string as the value of word to dict.
	e. Get size # get the size of the dict.
