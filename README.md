# CLI_lingae_learning
Just a little CLI game I made to simulate how human brain learns new words. 

## text analysis:
  There function that does some text analysis on the user input integer and extracts the command, the attribute, the word and the value. 
## actual app:
  gets size of dictionary, or the meaning of a particular word if needed. other stuff too. I'll add more detials if necesary.
